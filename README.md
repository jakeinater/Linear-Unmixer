# spectralILU
This small program is a proof of concept designed to read multiplexed data from fluorescent immuno-assays by determining different analyte concentrations using spectral imaging and linear unmixing. Hopefully this can be developed into an accurate and open source tool useful in biological assays and eventually be applied to highthroughput measurements.

note, you need to install gsl to use this program. https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
